# Advent of Code 2023

This repository includes my Python code for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Running From Command Line

To run this code from the command line, first clone this repository then move into the project's directory.

Insert your input files as an input.txt file in the folder for that day (e.g. for day 3, put your input into day03/input.txt).

Then run the code by entering the following into the command line (repace the day number and part number for the day and part you are running):

```
python day03/part1.py
```
